# DendriticNonlinearityNN

Testing neural network with dendritic nonlinearities on MNIST using methods similar to those in [this](http://file.scirp.org/Html/1-2550158_53491.htm) paper, written using Tensorflow.

This doesn't seem to work that well on high-dimensional input and multi-dimensional output.
